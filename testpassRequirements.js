//If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
//
//Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.


//In order to pass the test we have to:
//	find the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000
//	add those multiples up and return the sum



//method 1 findMultiplesWithinRange(rangeStart, rangeStop, multiples = []) should return an array containing all the multiples
	//it should return an array containing all the multiples within the range given
	//it should return an error if integers not given as first argument
	//it should return an error if integer not given as second argument
	//it should return an error if first argument is greater than the second
	//it should return an error if array not given as third argument
	//it should return an return an array of 3, 5, 6, 9 for a range of 0 to 10

//method 2 addAllIntegerValuesInArray(array) should return an integer
	//it should return an integer equal to the sum of all integers found in the array
	//it should return an error if argument is not an array
